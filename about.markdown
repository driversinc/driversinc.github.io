## About Drivers Incorporated

Drivers Incorporated has been in operation since 2007. We started as the response to a need: the need to end drunk driving. We hope that by providing a viable altnerative to people who are out with their cars we can make the streets a little safer. Weâ€™ve had the opportunity to help thousands of people get home safely with their cars.

We handpick and train our drivers, running backround checks on both criminal and Motor Vehicle Records, to ensure we are sending you the very best.  

In addition to designated driving, we have also partnered with Assisted Living Communities to drive people who can no longer operate their own vehicles safely, but want to remain independent.

Above all we respect the needs of the people and communities we serve. Please let us know if you have any suggestions, questions, or comments.
